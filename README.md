I'm Max, a freshman Electrical Engineer at RPI.
I am hoping to get concentrations in both the mixed signal design focus area and the micro/nano electronics and photonics focus area.
I enjoy any and all forms of circuit and hardware design and analysis.
All of my personal projects I like will be here, along with cross links to other sites (BitBuilt for example, as shown in the Wii Micro / Nandii repositories in the future)
Some school projects may be here as well if I like them enough.

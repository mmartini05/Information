I'm Max, a freshman Electrical Engineer at RPI.<br>
I am hoping to get concentrations in both the mixed signal design focus area and the micro/nano electronics and photonics focus area.<br>
I enjoy any and all forms of circuit and hardware design and analysis.<br>
All of my personal projects I like will be here, along with cross links to other sites (BitBuilt for example, as shown in the Wii Micro / Nandii repositories in the future).<br>
Some school projects may be here as well if I like them enough.<br>

Added projects from my Embedded Control (ENGR-2350) class - just my Lab 2-5 code in collaboration with Trent Maffeo.

Added (a few days ago) the nInterpreter project - it's a big one. Could change the controller landscape of competitive Mario Kart Wii
